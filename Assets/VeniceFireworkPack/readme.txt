The package with 13 high quality particle systems - fireworks with a controlling system of targeting and flying. This is v2 of the asset.
The package is fully compatible with free version of unity 4.0. It's optimized for PC client and for Web builds, also you can reduce the amount of emitted particles to use it on android and iOS builds.
==================================
This pack includes prefabs with explosion particle systems, prefab for a tracer particle system, a game object called "Firework controller" and a materials for them.
==================================
To start your work with the package you have to import it into your project, then drag an object"Firework controller" anywhere to your scene. After that, you have just to make some settings.
==================================  
You can choose the amount of fireworks to spawn. For good instuctions watch video manual on Youtube. 
PLEASE be sure, that all the variables have their values!
=== 
Please notice! The target positions must be higher (by Y coordinate) then starting position.
===
After that please create a plan of the explosions modifying the "Pref of expl" list. You can modify the size of the list and to drag and drop here prefabs with explosions, that you want to be created. The firework system will be looped by this list. After that you can start your scene and watch your fireworks working.
==================================
Also you can change the speed of flying firework and the range of random explosions. The speed variates from 0 to 1. 
If RangeOfRandom variable = 0, fireworks will explode exactly in target points. If RangeOfRandom = for example 10, fireworks will explode at random position of range 10 from target points.
==================================
Scaling particles is always a problem. If you want to scale my particles (explodes) just modify their living time and starting speed. Also you can change the size of each particle. You will see that changing this variables maked explodes wider or smaller.
